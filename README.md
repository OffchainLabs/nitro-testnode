# Nitro Testnode

Nitro-testnode brings up a full environment for local nitro testing (with or without Stylus support) including a dev-mode geth L1, and multiple instances with different roles.

### Requirements

* bash shell
* docker and docker-compose

All must be installed in PATH.

## Using latest nitro release (recommended)

### Without Stylus support

Check out the release branch of the repository.

> Notice: release branch may be force-pushed at any time.

```bash
git clone -b release --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-testnode.git
cd nitro-testnode
```

Initialize the node

```bash
./test-node.bash --init
```
To see more options, use `--help`.

### With Stylus support

Check out the stylus branch of the repository.
> Notice: stylus branch may be force-pushed at any time.

```bash
git clone -b stylus --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-testnode.git
cd nitro-testnode
```

Initialize the node

```bash
./test-node.bash --init
```
To see more options, use `--help`.

## Using current nitro code (local compilation)

Check out the nitro or stylus repository. Use the test-node submodule of nitro repository.

> Notice: testnode may not always be up-to-date with config options of current nitro node, and is not considered stable when operated in that way.

### Without Stylus support
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro.git
cd nitro/nitro-testnode
```

Initialize the node in dev-mode (this will build the docker images from source)
```bash
./test-node.bash --init --dev
```
To see more options, use `--help`.

### With Stylus support
```bash
git clone -b stylus --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus.git
cd stylus/nitro-testnode
```

Update the nitro-testnet repository and checkout stylus branch
```bash
git pull
git checkout stylus
```

Initialize the node in dev-mode (this will build the docker images from source)
```bash
./test-node.bash --init --dev
```
To see more options, use `--help`.

## Further information

### Working with docker containers

**sequencer** is the main docker to be used to access the nitro testchain. It's http and websocket interfaces are exposed at localhost ports 8547 and 8548 ports, respectively.

Stopping, restarting nodes can be done with docker-compose.

### Helper scripts

Some helper scripts are provided for simple testing of basic actions.

To fund the address 0x1111222233334444555566667777888899990000 on l2, use:

```bash
./test-node.bash script send-l2 --to address_0x1111222233334444555566667777888899990000
```

For help and further scripts, see:

```bash
./test-node.bash script --help
